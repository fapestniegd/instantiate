mkvm:
  - did not roll back when disk space was not sufficient
  - did not get added to Operating Systems
  - did not re-run dhcplinsk while waiting for [installing]
  - did not set operating system type in virtualcenter (thus did not power on)
  - did not get tftp files until next server was changed to IP 192.168.1.217
  - did not set --ip in kickstart file, because it was not in windows DNS
  - The CentOS installation tree does not seem to match installation media 5.5->
5.7 (recollections)
