An automated (and non-blocking) system for deploying: 
    bare-metal via PXE
    vmware esx virtual machines from pxe or by template
    ec2 instances by template
    linode instances by template
and just enough config management (jecm) to bootstrap puppet or cfengine3

# Install

Validate that: (if type != vmware, and we don't control IP assigment, skip this)
  1) The displayname is a fully-qualified-domain-name
  2) The fully-qualified-domain-name has an A record in DNS
  3) The A record has a PTR Record
  /* ( Ideally it would grab an available one and add the A & PTR) */

Ensure that:
  4) The host is in ou=Hosts (add if necessary)
  5) Set the userPassword on the SimpleSecurity ObjectClass of the host
  6) The host is in cn=DHCP  (add if necessary)
  7) The host is in (cn=*, ou=Operating Systems,...) (prompt OS Type if not)

Once Valid, Deploy VM in virtualcenter
Get MAC address
update CN=DHCP with mac address, filename, server
set filename = pxelinux.install

# set up pxe for the install
wget http://newton.eftdomain.net/cgi-bin/dhcplinks.cgi
    template out install_<hostname> based on what ou=distribution the host is in
    (template out kickstart, unattended, the same way)

    if (filename == pxelinux.install in the LDAP entry)
      point to install_<hostname>
    else
      point to main_menu

Boot vm (it should pxe boot)
ping VM until up (for N pings)
set filename = pxelinux.localboot in DHCP entry
ping until down
ping VM until up
If type != vmware, and we don't control IP assigment
   grab the IP from the system, (update DNS A, PTR records)
   using the userPassword, revoke any existing certificates, keypairs (cfengine)
   generate private key & csr
   using the userPassword sign csr with pkild
   have host rotate out userPassword
run cfengine||puppet
